This folder contains source files for the new `dendrapply` implementation. 
These files may be out of date--I have moved to keeping the most up-to-date source in the `new_dendrapply_patch.diff` file. 
Use these at your own risk; they are tested, but not *that* tested. A working implementation is available in the `SynExtend` 
package, or you can see Bugzilla report #18480 for the latest code.
